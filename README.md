# LooperAcc

Loop station for mobile devices (smart phones, tablets). It records from your microfone to 2 stacked tracks. 
You can add effects and control them through the position (accelerometer) of your device. 
To run on your device you will need 2 files: LooperAcc.pd and LooperAcc.mmp. 
The LooperAcc.pd file is the engine in Pure Data, the LooperAcc.mmp file is the interface.
