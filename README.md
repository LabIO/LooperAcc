# LooperAcc
This is a handy loop station for mobile devices (smart phones, tablets)
Download the LooperAcc.pd and LooperAcc.mmp files to your device with <a href="http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/">MobMuPlat</a> installed.
The .pd file is the engine in Pure Data, the .mmp file is the mobile interface. The .pd file can be opened 
with Pd on your computer.
Open MobMuPlat and look for LooperAcc.mmp, click on it and record and loop, and have fun!
