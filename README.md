# LooperAcc
This is a 2 track loop station for mobile devices (smart phones, tablets). To run on your device you will need 2 files: the LooperAcc.pd file is the engine in Pure Data can be opened and edited with Pd on your computer, the LooperAcc.mmp file is the MobMuPlat mobile interface. 
1) Install <a href="http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/">MobMuPlat</a>
2) Download the LooperAcc.pd and LooperAcc.mmp files to your device with  installed.
3) MOVE THESE FILES INTO THE MOBMUPLAT DIRECTORY This is the "tricky" part. Use the file browser app of your device to access the Downloads directory, then copy and past the two files into the mobMuPlat directory that is found at your device root location.
4) Open MobMuPlat and look for LooperAcc.mmp, click on it and record and loop, and have fun!
